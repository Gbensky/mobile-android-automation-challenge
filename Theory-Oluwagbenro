1) Why did you choose the framework you used?
I used Espresso because
    a. It was an opportunity to build up my skills in writing automated test using Espresso.
    b. It is the framework used by the company.

2) What were the advantages and disadvantages of your choice?
    Advantages
        a. Easy to setup
        b. Speed: The tests scripts execute fast.
        c. Stability: It is stable due to the fact that is tightly coupled to the native
           environment and there is continuous support.
        d. It supports white-box testing making it easier to access identifiers and views
        e. It supports easy continuous integration as the tests run in the same pipeline
            as the development code. This makes releasing features to production faster
    Disadvantages
        a. It doesn't support cross platform automated testing
        b. It can only be written in Java or Kotlin

3) What was the most complicated part?
    Writing a test script for the Search Exercise ListView when the user's Wifi is not switched on.
    This was complicated because writing a helper function to achieve this on a physical device was
    hard and writing for just the emulator is not advisable.

4) Which good coding practices did you follow when writing your tests?
    a. The Page Object Model Design Pattern
    b. The KISS Principle
    c. Encapsulation
    d. Single Responsibility Principle

5) How do you make sure your code is maintainable by other team members?

    a. By using descriptive names when creating variables and functions for easy readability and understandability
    b. By following the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring that each test suite caters for only one feature/module of the application
    c. By creating independent tests
